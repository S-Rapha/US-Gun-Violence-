### Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle, a widely recognized platform for sharing and accessing high-quality datasets.

### Tools

- Excel: Data Cleaning and Structuring
- Power Bi: Analysis, Visualization, and giving Report

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

  This dataset was cleaned and structured using Excel Power Query to ensure readiness for analysis. The key steps involved in data preparation included:
  1. Removing Duplicates: Eliminated redundant records to maintain accuracy and consistency.
  2. Handling Missing Values: Addressed incomplete data by either filling in gaps or removing irrelevant rows.
  3. Standardizing Data Formats: Unified formats for dates, categorical values, and numeric fields for seamless analysis.
  4. Transforming Data: Applied necessary transformations, such as grouping data by year and region for trend analysis.

     This structured approach ensured that the dataset was accurate, complete, and well-organized for subsequent analysis and visualization in Power BI.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) focused on uncovering trends, patterns, and insights within the dataset. By leveraging the capabilities of Power BI, the analysis examined key variables to provide a comprehensive understanding of gun-related incidents in the United States over the past decade.

- Identified peak periods for firearm incidents.
- Mapped incidents across states and regions to highlight areas with higher gun violence rates.
- Explored the types of firearms involved and their prevalence.
- Analyze yearly and monthly trends to observe increases or decreases in gun-related incidents over time.
- Investigated potential relationships between incidents and demographic factors such as age or gender.
- Analyze the outcomes of incidents to show record of injuries, fatalities and, victims.

### Findings and Insights

1. The analysis reveal thst there is a large number of gun-related fatalities invoving case of **Unknow** mental health status, with a significant gap in data colection.
2. In the past decade over 130 police officers have been in just three state with Illinois toping the list with 52 police office killed, California 46, and Florida 32.
3. It was discovered that over 43% of firearm bearer status for weapon obtained are unknown, 30% were obtained illegal,  and 26% legally.

6. Over 1,834 incidents were classified as random shootings, highlighting unpredictable nature of gun violence and the risk it poses to public safety.

### Recommendations

-  Improving mental health data availability for crucial understanding to addressing factors associated with gun violence more effectively
-  Illinois, California, and Florida requires target analysis to understand contributing factors and develop strategies to enhance officers safety
-  The record analysis shows both legal and illegal weapons contribute to violence, while unknown data emphasize the need for more detailed tracking in weapon possession records
-  ⁠There is a need for targeted intervention programs focused on at-risk youth. Addressing underlying factors like education, mental health, and community support could be essential in preventing such tragic incidents.
-  It is important to note that mental health evaluation is highly recommended for gun license policy.
-  states with high gun incident are highly recommended to implement strict gun law.
